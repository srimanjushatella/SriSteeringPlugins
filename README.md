The main aim of this pluggin model is to implement an intelligent hunting behaviour of predator.

Hunting behavior

1. Hunting behavior differs from seeking or pursuing in that the hunter’s goal is to capture the
prey, whether through seeking or pursuing it.

2. A hunter has two behavior modes: prowl and chase.

3. Prowling is like wandering except the predator, while wandering, is also on the lookout for
an opportunity to seize some prey should it come into its killzone.

4. In chasing, the hunter steps up its pace and pursues the prey if the distance is farther and
seek, otherwise. However, the predator can’t chase forever. It prowls in bursts and must tire
eventually and return to prowl behavior.

5. The killzone​ is an imaginary a triangular region of space of the front-facing plane of the
predator.

6. A hunter thus has limited forward sight, both in depth and peripheral vision. Anything
outside the kill zone is a blind spot.

7. Catching prey means colliding with the prey; rectangular collision detection is sufficient.

8. Upon catching prey, the prey is killed and removed from the world.
